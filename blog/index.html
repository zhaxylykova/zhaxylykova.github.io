        <p>I have very interesting taste of music, though, I want to introduce you to my favourite female artist. She is Lana Del Rey. Her famous song is called "Summertime Sadness". However my fave is "young and beautiful", which was used in the famous film with Leo DiCaprio, called "The Great Gatsby". In the song the main character complains and get upset due to her fear of getting older. </p>
